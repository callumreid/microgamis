### Recent Changes - 2025-07-08

#### Added
- **In-Game Push-to-Talk Button**: Added web-compatible PTT button directly to "Advise the Child" game component
  - Button appears after AI host finishes speaking (when player input is needed)
  - Visual feedback: üé§ when ready, üî¥ when speaking, with scaling animation
  - Works with both mouse (click & hold) and touch (tap & hold) interactions
  - Positioned in yellow-themed section matching game UI style
  - Only shows when session is connected and WebRTC is ready

#### Fixed
- **useEffect Infinite Loop**: Removed `updateMessage` from dependency array in GameComponent.tsx
  - Was causing "Maximum update depth exceeded" error in BaseGame.tsx:121

  - Safe to remove since it's only called once during component mount

#### Technical Implementation Details
